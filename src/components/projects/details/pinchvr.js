            <p>This project is focusing on bridging the disconnection between
            newcomers/refugees that are in need of help and kind hearted people
            who wants to help by donating clothing and other supplies.
            The project started as a platform to help newcomerâ€™s families to
            earn some extra money by selling their home made food.
            We found that many people are using social media to sell
            their home made food. But when we dig deeper into market research,
            we found that there has already been platforms that are doing
            the same thing. So pivoted from Soul Food to Fair Trade. </p>

              <h3>Team and Roles</h3>
              <p>In this project I worked as a UX designer collaboration
              with another UI/UX designer and later on I used Unity to build
              a working prototype in Angel Hack 2018 Toronto. After winning
              the hackathon, I continued working on Fair Trade to shape the
              branding and user experience. </p>
