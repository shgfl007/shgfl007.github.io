While AR apps provide a better solution for regular users that don't have many experiences\n          with professional 3d software.\n        </p>\n        <p>Also as human, we do have a natural understanding of the 3-dimensional world by observing the size of we see an object and its shadow.</p>\n\n        <p>After conducting the research, I started to build prototypes based on my discoveries.</p>\n\n        <div className='project-section'>\n          <h2>Design, Mockup and Iterations</h2>\n          <hr/>\n\n          <div className='split-section'>\n            <div className='split-left'><img src={brios1}/></div>\n            <div className='split-right'>\n              <h3 className='section-title'>The Sketch</h3>\n              <p className='first-section-par'>Based on the discoveries, I first did some sketches before going deeper into the design.</p>\n              <p>I used simple elements to test out my assumptions: a cube, the grid, and the indicator. The sketches include\n                something similar to real-world shadows that would be affected by the shape of the objects, also something more abstract\n                (a ring that represents the rough size of the object).\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <h3 className='section-title'>The Mockup</h3>\n          <p className='first-section-par'>I took some of the sketches and put it in Adobe XD on top of screenshots of the Brio builder.

Before getting into it, I explain what was expected for the indicator.

The height indicator was referring to rulers and grid system we were using in Brio. The distance\n                between each dot is the same distance between each 'x' on the grid.

This version of the prototype was\n            focusing on the core concept of the app. The reason why I chose Unity instead of another coding/ programming\n            tools was that using Unity I can focus on the flow and functionality instead of how the app would look.\n            Also, I could use the Canvas system to map out the UI elements in no time. It’s not conventional to use\n            Unity to create a prototype, but considering the time frame, it was the best choice.</p>\n          <p>The prototype included the process of the shopper making a trade offer using the Karma Points he/she\n            currently owned and the app sent the donor a text message. When the donor accepted the trade, the\n            system sends back a text message back to the shopper.</p>\n          <p>We tested out the flow using the prototype at the hackathon, it seemed that the texting part wasn't\n            too familiar to some of the users since there aren't too many apps that would send a text message to\n            users. In the later iterations, we could add the option for people to choose whether they would like\n            to be contacted by email or text. And for users that are using the mobile app, we would also send\n            them to push notifications to their devices when they got an offer. We thought for shoppers we\n            still want to receive a text message as a default method for receiving notifications from the\n            app considering they might not have the access to the Internet at hands. For the text messages,\n            we would also like to use services that the users could text us back if they would like to accept\n            or reject the offer.</p>\n\n          <h3 className='section-title'>Prototype (Update)</h3>\n          <div className='project-image'>\n            <iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FV3yFSt6CulJUnVl2Y6JxbB%2Ffairtrade_prototype_update%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1\" allowFullscreen></iframe>\n          </div>\n          <p>After the hackathon, we created an updated prototype that includes more screens then we had in the Unity version.

Rule\n              A allows the player to create items using a certain recipe on the\n              ground, then pick up the new item and use it against other\n              players. In this process, many things could happen. The other\n              player can pick up your new item. The other player could mess\n              up your recipe by adding another item. These situations happened\n              during our 20 minutes session and we believe this would happen to\n              the players if we choose rule A. Also rule A added a layer of\n              complexity since the items wouldn't work unless they were\n              combined with at less a different item. This could slow done the\n              game and change the rhythm. Thus this might lead the players to\n              focus more on creating items instead of the goal of the map.\n              This could break the game.</p>\n            <p>Rule B seemed a little better than rule A in terms of complexity.\n              Rule B doesn't require players to pick up items - throw it to\n              another item - pickup new item - use it. The process of using\n              item is much easier: pickup, then throw on the ground. Rule B\n              added ground events to the game and made it more fun but not\n              more complected to play. However, we did find that it still steal\n              players attention away from achieving the goal of the map a bit.</p>\n          <p>In conclusion, none of the rules were good enough to go to\n            development. Rule A seemed too complicated and created a mess.\n            Rule B seemed more suitable, but it still steals the player's\n            attention away. We would focus a bit more on rule B but try not to\n            take away players attention off the goal too much.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className='project-section'>\n              <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n              <hr/>\n              <Takeaways entries={takeaways} />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {foguangBKG, fgflow, fgIA, briop1, briop2, fgmain,fgphoto,fgp1, fgdp, fgvid, fgdd,fgaudio,fgflow2,fgui} from '../../../Constants/Image'\nimport Persona from './components/persona'\nimport { Link, DirectLink, Element, Events, animateScroll as scroll, scrollSpy, scroller } from 'react-scroll'\nimport Takeaways from './components/Takeaways'\nimport ProjectNav from './components/projectNav'\n\nconst personas = [\n  {name:'Tina', age:'20', img: briop2,\n    description:'Tina is a college student that is majored in Architecture.

For the phone rotation animation, I didn't choose to give it ease since it might make the animation look better, but the will mislead the user to have sudden movements of their phone, which is not good for computer vision.

Users felt insecure about their creations: is my object saved? Is my scene saved? We've all experienced loss when an app just crashed, and we don't want our users to always have this feeling of insecure. We decided to change this.</p>\n            <p>I added a new status bar with the Brio accent colour after the loading bar to ensure users that their model is saved. I added a save icon as well at the beginning of the bar so it takes a glimpse to understand that something has been saved. The same idea for the save status indicator. A saved notification would slide in after saving the scene. They are in the same location, so users won't be confused about whether the scene has been saved. Normally we would want more noticeable animations, but since Brio autosaves, we shouldn't take users attention too much (imagine seeing \"Congratulations! Your scene has been saved!\" every time you try to move an object). </p>\n          </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        </div>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n    </div>);\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {pinchBKG} from '../../../Constants/Image'\n\n\nexport default class FairTrade extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div className='header-home animated project-header-section' >\n            <h1 className='title'>Pinch Discovery App & VR Collaborate Space</h1>\n            <hr/>\n            <h3>PinchVR</h3>\n\n          </div>\n          <div className='project-content animated'>\n            <div className='project-section'>\n              <h2>Pinch Discovery</h2>\n              <div className='project-image'><img src={pinchBKG}/></div>\n            <p>The Pinch Discovery app is an application that ships with the headset and the controller.\n            The propose for the app was to showcase the possibilities of the controllers and the SDK.</p>\n\n              <h3 className='section-title'>Team and Roles</h3>\n              <p className='first-section-par'>I worked as a Unity developer.

Then one\n            day, I realized that this is not going to work! Functionality is not good enough.\n            Creating a product / interactive experiences that don't speak to the user/audience is\n            not good at all. Even with interactive digital arts, it needs to make sense to the\n            audiences in terms of how the piece works. Then I studied User-Centered Design in my\n            masters and it opened a new world for me.\n        </p>\n        <p>Now I use what I learned before to craft experiences that users/audiences that can\n          easily interact with.

This is from my creative coder era when\n          my mentor always says \"demo or die\". I also like to try new things. I learn new skills\n           and tools by using them. I love to hear feedback from people and make changes to\n           enhance their quality of life using the product by making changes according to their feedback.\n        </p>\n        </div>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, {Component} from 'react'\nimport {Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Project from './projects/ProjectLists'\nimport Home from './header/header'\nimport About from './about/About'\n//import Project from './Projects'\nimport BRIOVR from './projects/details/Briovr'\nimport FairTrade from './projects/details/fairtrade'\nimport bkaleg from './projects/details/breakaleg'\nimport foguang from './projects/details/foguang'\nimport Geogram from './projects/details/geogram'\nimport Animation from './projects/details/animation'\n\nexport default class Main extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <main>\n      <div className='main'>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path='/' component={Home}/>\n        <Route path='/projects' component={Project}/>\n        <Route path='/about' component={About}/>\n        <Route exact path='/projects' component={Project} />\n        <Route path='/projects/briovr' component={BRIOVR} />\n        <Route path='/projects/fairtrade' component={FairTrade} />\n        <Route path='/projects/break-a-leg' component={bkaleg} />\n        <Route path='/projects/foguang-temple' component={foguang} />\n        <Route path='/projects/animation' component={Animation} />\n        <Route path='/projects/geogram' component={Geogram} />\n      </Switch>\n    </div>\n  </main>)\n  }\n\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Footer extends Component {\n    render() {\n      return (\n      <div className='footer'>\n        <div className='contact'>\n          <p>Find me on:\n            <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/danninglu/' target='_blank'><i className='social fab fa-linkedin-in'/></a>\n          <a href='https://twitter.com/cyrusHisa' target='_b'><i className='social fab fa-twitter'/></a></p>\n\n        </div>\n        <p>Designed and Created by Danning Lu</p>\n      </div>\n      )\n    }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.scss';\nimport './main.scss';\nimport Header from './components/header/header'\nimport Nav from './components/navbar/nav'\nimport Main from './components/Main'\nimport Footer from './components/footer/footer'\n\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <Nav />\n        <Main />\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { withRouter } from 'react-router'\n\nclass ScrollToTop extends Component {\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    if (this.props.location !== prevProps.location) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default withRouter(ScrollToTop)\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport {HashRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport createBrowserHistory from \"history/createBrowserHistory\";\nimport ScrollToTop from './Helper/ScrollToTop'\n\nconst history = createBrowserHistory()\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  (<HashRouter onUpdate={() => window.scrollTo(0, 0)}>\n    <ScrollToTop>\n      <App />\n    </ScrollToTop>\n\n  </HashRouter>), document.getElementById('root'));\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
