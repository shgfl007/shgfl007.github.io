This version of prototype was focusing on the core concept of the app. The reason why I chose Unity instead of other coding / programming\n          tools was because that using Unity I can focus on the flow and functionality instead of how the app would look. Also I could use the Canvas system to map out the UI elements in no time. It’s not conventional to\n          use Unity to create a prototype, but considering the time frame, it was the best choice.</p>\n          <p>The prototype included the process of the shopper making an trade offer using the Karma Points he/she currently owned and the app sent the donor a text message. When the donor accepted the trade, the system send back\n          a text message back to the shopper. </p>\n          <p>We tested out the flow using the prototype at the hackathon, it seemed that the texting part wasn't too famaliar to some of the users since there isn't too many apps that would send\n          text message to users. In the later iterations, we could add the option for people to choose whether they would like to be contacted by email or text. And for users that are using the mobile app, we would also send them\n          push notifications to their devices when they got an offer. We thought for shoppers we still want receiving text message as a default method for receiving notifications from the app considering they might not have the access\n          to the Internet at hands. For the text messages, we would also like to use services that the users could text us back if they would like to accept or reject the offer.</p>\n\n          <h3 className='section-title'>Prototype (Update)</h3>\n          <div className='project-image'>\n            <iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FV3yFSt6CulJUnVl2Y6JxbB%2Ffairtrade_prototype_update%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1\" allowFullscreen></iframe>\n          </div>\n          <p>After the hackathon, we created an updated prototype that includes more screens then we had in the Unity version.

Rule A allows player to\n            create items using a certain receipe on the ground, then pick up the new item and use it against other players. In this precess, many things could happen.\n            The other player can pickup your new item. The other player could mess up your receipe by adding another item. These situations happened during our 20 minutes\n            session and we believe this would happen to the players if we choose rule A. Also rule A added a layer of complexity since the items wouldn't work unless they\n            were combined with at less a different item. This could slow done the game and change the rythm. Thus this might lead the players to focus more on creating items\n            instead of the the goal of the map. This could break the game.</p>\n            <p>Rule B seemed a little better than rule A in terms of complexity. Rule B doesn't require players to pickup items - throw it to another item - pickup new item - use it.\n            The process of using item is much easier: pickup, then throw on the ground. Rule B added ground events to the game and made it more fun but not more complected to play.\n            However, we did find that it still steal players attention away from achiving the goal of the map a bit. </p>\n          <p>In conclusion, none of the rules were good enough to go to development. Rule A seemed too complicated and created a mess. Rule B seemed more suitable, but it still steal player's\n          attention away. We would focus a bit more on rule B but try not to take away players attention off the goal too much.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className='project-section'>\n              <h2>Takeaways</h2>\n              <hr/>\n              <Takeaways entries={takeaways} />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {foguangBKG, fgflow, fgIA, briop1, briop2, fgmain,fgphoto,fgp1, fgdp, fgvid, fgdd,fgaudio,fgflow2,fgui} from '../../../Constants/Image'\nimport Persona from './components/persona'\nimport { Link, DirectLink, Element, Events, animateScroll as scroll, scrollSpy, scroller } from 'react-scroll'\nimport Takeaways from './components/Takeaways'\n\nconst personas = [\n  {name:'Tina', age:'20', img: briop2,\n    description:'Tina is a college student that is majored in Architecture.

We decided to include the inspector for waypoints as well since they are also 3D obejcts as well.\n          In case the user doesn't notice the indicator, we decided to add some motion to the indicator when the user selects the waypoint indicator. If this helps users to use the indicator more, we would therefore add this feature to all indicators.</p>\n          <p>The concept for the animation was to have a subtle movement that would be enough for people to notice but not to surprise them. I decided to have a slide down animation and just give it an ease-in and ease-out to smooth the transition.</p>\n        </div>\n\n\n\n        <div className='project-section'>\n          <h2>AR Viewer For BRIOVR</h2>\n          <hr/>\n          <div className='split-section'>\n            <div className='split-left'><video className='brio-animation section-title' src={arFlow} autoPlay='autoPlay' loop='loop' muted='muted' width='400'/></div>\n            <div className='split-right'>\n              <video className='brio-animation section-title' src={arFlow2} autoPlay='autoPlay' loop='loop' muted='muted' width='400'/>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <p className='first-section-par'>The Brio AR viewer was pushed out quickly due to customer requirements. I was assigned to rework on the AR viewer to make it easy to use.</p>\n          <p>The left-hand side animation was made in Principle for testing. The right-hand side is the version I made with After Effects for a better adjustments on motions based on the\n          prototype made with Principle. For the phone rotation animation, I didn't choose to give it an ease since it might make the animation look better, but the will mislead the user to\n          have sudden movements of their phone, which is not good for computer vision. In order to have a faster recognition of the space, we would want the user to move their phone slowly and steady.</p>\n          <p>The bouncing effect adds a bit more fun and excitement to the app since our target was designers and educators. Their audiences would be more sensitive to animations. I hope to bring the feeling of excitement to the user and their viewers\n          when they sees their creations in real world via the lens and Brio. This could help with creating a memory and a story together with the user and Brio.</p>\n\n          <div className='project-section'>\n            <h2>Placement Indicator for BRIOVR</h2>\n            <hr/>\n            <div className='brio-fin-video section-title'><video className='brio-animation project-image' src={height} autoPlay=\"autoPlay\" loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\"/></div>\n            <p className='first-section-par'>This is the feature that I worked on and tried many different things with it.

But when it gets to 100%, it just disapears. The same thing happens to the save indicator, it shows Brio is\n            saving, but it never tells the user if it's saved. We got complains about this. Users felt insecure about their creations: is my object saved? Is my scene saved? We've all experienced lose when an app just crashed, and we don't\n            want our users to always have this feeling of insecure. We decided to change this.</p>\n            <p>I added a new status bar with the Brio accent colour after the loading bar to ensure users that their model is saved. I added a save icon as well at the beginning of the bar so it takes a glimpse to understand that something\n            has been saved. Same idea for the save status indicator. A saved notification would slide in after saving the scene. They are in the same location, so users won't be confused about whether the scene has been saved. Normally we\n            would want more noticeable animations, but since Brio auto saves, we shouldn't take users attention too much (imaging seeing \"Congratualations! Your scene has been saved!\" everytime you try to move an object).   </p>\n          </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        </div>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n    </div>);\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport {Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Project from './Projects'\nimport BRIOVR from './details/Briovr'\nimport FairTrade from './details/fairtrade'\nimport bkaleg from './details/breakaleg'\nimport foguang from './details/foguang'\nimport Geogram from './details/geogram'\nimport Animation from './details/animation'\n\n\nexport default class ProjectList extends Component {\n  render(){\n    return(\n      <main>\n    <Switch>\n    <Route exact path='/projects' component={Project} />\n    <Route path='/projects/briovr' component={BRIOVR} />\n    <Route path='/projects/fairtrade' component={FairTrade} />\n    <Route path='/projects/break-a-leg' component={bkaleg} />\n    <Route path='/projects/foguang-temple' component={foguang} />\n    <Route path='/projects/animation' component={Animation} />\n    </Switch>\n    </main>)\n  }\n\n\n\n}\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class About extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    const profile = '../assets/img/profile_new.png';\n    return (\n      <div className=''>\n        <div className='header-home animated'>\n          <h1 className=\"title\">About</h1>\n          <h2 className=\"description\">Interaction Designer - Creative Coder</h2>\n        </div>\n        <div className='project-content animated'>\n          <p className='first-section-par'>I'm a creative coder turned into interaction designer.</p>\n          <p>When I was creating experiences with code, I hardly think about how easy/hard it was for people to\n          interact with it. \"As long as it works.\" said me and my peer coders. Then one day, I realized that this\n          is not going to work! Functionality is not good enough. Creating a product / interactive experiences that\n          doesn't speak to the user/audience is not good at all. Even with interactive digital arts, it needs to make\n          sense to the audiences in terms of how the piece works.
